# Unmasking the Face: Emotion Detection using Machine Learning

Human beings are responsible for the depiction of six basic emotions: **happiness, anger, surprise, sadness, fear**, and **disgust**. Creating a model that can accurately classify these emotions can be extremely useful in a variety of areas such as image processing, cybersecurity, robotics, psychological studies, virtual reality applications, etc. 

The **main objective** of this capstone is to create models to categorize faces based on the emotion shown in the expression into one of seven categories (the six basic emotions plus one category for neutral).
