# Final Capstone
Facial Expression Classification and Feature Extraction 

Human beings are responsible for the depiction of six basic emotions: **happiness, anger, surprise, sadness, fear**, and **disgust**. Creating a model that can accurately classify these emotions can be extremely useful in a variety of areas such as image processing, cybersecurity, robotics, psychological studies, virtual reality applications, etc. 

The **main objective** of this capstone is to categorize faces based on the emotion shown in the expression into one of seven categories (the six basic emotions plus one category for neutral).
